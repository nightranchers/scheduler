"""
Here's the format we're looking for

		POS	POS
SLOT	RB	MT
SLOT	RB	MT
SLOT	RB	MT
SLOT	RB	MT

So first column will be the slots
the rest of the columns will be employee's initials assigned to the postion found at the top of the column

each column needs to be formatted into a dictionary
the heading is the key and the rest are values
the slot times need to be in a list
